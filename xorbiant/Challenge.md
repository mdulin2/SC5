## Xorbitant
XOR is used all the time for encryption because it's super fast and easy to reverse. I was in even more of a hurry than normal, so I didn't have time to make a proper [one time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad). It should be fine though, I just copied the short key I had a few times until it was long enough.

Here's the secret message: `25190d365d5f0405513e7a42133b54215c6f1028592a4c5c1305512b7a5d1f294d3e40540b`

Flag format: `SC5{some_text_here}``

- Hint: You'll need to figure out the length of the key, how could you determine a key length was _not valid_?

- Hint: The flag is in english, this is very helpful in knowing when you're close.

- Hint: This might take multiple steps of trial and error, you don't need to solve it in one step.
