## Challenge
- "Hey kids! Have you ever tried mining Bitcoin!? It's an easy way to make money! Do you know how it works?"
- You take some data and append data to the front until the 'hash' of the data has lots of zeros! 
- For this challenge, there is a server that you interact with via Python - you have a client program to use for this. All you need to worry about doing is sending the prepended data that created the hash with lots of zeros. 
- Write some code to prepend the starting 7 bytes with zeros. There is a (1/16)^7 probability this will work! You only have a minute to do so! :) Good luck!
- Hint: 
	- Just do it randomly. There's no better way.
