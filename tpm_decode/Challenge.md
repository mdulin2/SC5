## Decode Me 1 
- Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a special security chip used for storing secrets among other things. There is a standard *binary* protocol for interacting with TPMs from your computer. 
- The goal is to *decode* the command to find the information. Reading binary is not uncommon, but seems to happen to me a lot. So, reading a specification to decode commands is an important skill to have. 
- The flag is the 'Command Code Name'. It should have a format like 'TPM_CC_XXXXXXX'
- Command: [0x80,0x1,0x0,0x0,0x0,0xC,0x0,0x0,0x1,0x7b,0x0,0x4]
- Hint: Documents you will need - https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-Rev-2.0-Part-1-Architecture-01.07-2014-03-13.pdf and https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG_TPM2_r1p59_Part2_Structures_pub.pdf
- Hint: Section 18.9 shows the overall structure of the command
- Hint: PDF search is your friend :)
