How to spin up:

Very easy: Start with list.html. Open the HTML file in Chrome.

There are 2 pages total:
- list.html: list of all the hotels. One of these hotel is the correct flag.
- cart.html: mimic a checkout screen. The participant will need to analyze the information provided to them in order to identify the hotel in question


Make it clear that these places and images have nothing to do with the real answer.
Hot rate is different than the nightly rate. It's a special rate. 

You're looking for cheap rates for hotels in Seattle. You found a website that will give you a random hotel in Seattle at a discounted rate. However, it doesn't tell you WHICH hotel until after you've completed the checkout. Can you figure out the hotel you're staying at from the checkout screen? The flag is the name of the hotel but you only get ONE answer - use your attempt wisely.

P.S. Vanessa has used this on Hotwire.com in the past, which is what inspired at the challenge.
