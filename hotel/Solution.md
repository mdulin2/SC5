## Solution

There are 17 hotels. To narrow it down, we need to look at the listed hotel and the options. 

First, the target hotel has 4.4/5 rating which only leaves four hotels. 
  
Second, the hotel has 1144 ratings. This only leaves with two hotels: Renaissance Hotel and Thompson hotel. 

The last hint is very subtle. The description in the cart says resturant**s** (plural), vs resturant (singular). Since the description of the Renaissance Hotel is plural, this narrows down the solution to this one.
