## Challenge 
You're looking for cheap rates for hotels in Seattle. You found a website that will give you a random hotel in Seattle at a discounted rate. However, it doesn't tell you WHICH hotel until after you've completed the checkout. Can you figure out the hotel you're staying at from the checkout screen? The flag is the name of the hotel but you only get ONE answer - use your attempt wisely. NOTE: The images will be different between the two parts of it.

P.S. Vanessa has used this on Hotwire.com in the past, which is what inspired at the challenge.
