## Student Management System 
- What would you do if you had credentials for a student? 
- Trying to create a gradebook system: 
	- https://github.com/rgebica/Online-Gradebook
	- https://github.com/AngelaJR/gradebook
	- https://github.com/francoisjacquet/rosariosis
- The last one seems the most promising because of the docs for installation:
	- https://github.com/francoisjacquet/rosariosis/blob/mobile/INSTALL.md


## Challenges 
- Setup: 
	- Execute the sql queries within ``setup_postgres.sh``
	- Add three users: 
		- 10 - mdulin:mdulin - creds given out to people
		- 11 - vdulin:RANDOM_PASSWORD - Bug 1 victim
		- RANDOM_ID - nkirkland:nkirkland - Bug 3 victim
	- Delete all default creds besides the student
	- Add a class
	- Add some grades to that
	- Put flag within the grade notes of Vanessa
	- Put flag in address or something like that for Nathan
- View wrong students grades via IDOR
	- Bug 1
	- How to add: 
		- Remove 'isHack' variable from the Current.php file inside of 'SetUserStudentID' function for the student. 
		- Remove check on the first line of student as well
		- Insert flag as the last name or something like that
		- This modification literally changes the student ID of the session. So, everything after this is SUPER easy.
	- User setup: 
		- Two users with a similar ID
	- Grades/info/etc. 
- Default creds for teacher/student not changed: 
	- Bug 2 
	- Insert flag inside page.
	- Just read the docs

	- username the same as the password
