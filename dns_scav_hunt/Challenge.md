# DNS Records Scavenger Hunt 

Lots of interesting information can be found in DNS and domain registration records. Letâ€™s dig up some details using publicly available information!

## Email Destination

If I want to send an email to  
someone@mcdonalds.com, what IP address would I send my message to?

* Hint: If I want to send postal mail to MX-Donald's... I mean, McDonald's, I need to look them up in a directory. What is the system that email servers use to lookup recipient addresses? 

## Find the Hosting Provider

The creator of the Spokane Cyber Cup is Maxwell Dulin and he runs an awesome website at https://maxwelldulin.com. You should check it out sometime! Where does he host his website from?

* Hint: This is a tough one - I might need a PTR... I mean pointer!

## Domain Registration Lookup

The Spokesman Review is a local newspaper and one of the longest running in the area. They run a domain, https://spokesman.com. What is the email address of the admin of this domain?

* Hint: If you ask me who the admin is, I'd ask you right back, "WHOIS it?"
