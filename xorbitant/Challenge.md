## Xorbitant
XOR is used all the time for encryption because it's super fast and easy to reverse. I was in even more of a hurry than normal, so I didn't have time to make a proper [one time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad). It should be fine though, I just copied the short key I had a few times until it was long enough.

Here's the secret message: `257a065909023b2950407d0308281a554a7d171f2811505f472e042f29545a51041e2c1244`

Flag format: `SC5{some_text_here}``

- Hint: You'll need to figure out the length of the key, how could you determine a key length was _not valid_?

- Hint: The flag is in english, this is very helpful in knowing when you're close.

- Hint: This can be done on paper with a bit of effort, don't overthink it.
