Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet SC5{HoGwarts Drive, were proud to
say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They
were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything
strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such
nonsense.

Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which
made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck,
although he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was
thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck,
which came in very useful SchOOl as she spent so much of her time craning
over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a
small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer
boy anywhere.

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a
secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover
it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about
the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t
met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn’t
have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband
were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys
shuddered to think what the oF neighbours would say if the Potters
arrived in the street. Dursleys knew that the Potters had a
small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was
another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t
want Dudley mixing with a child like that.

When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey Tuesday
our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to
suggest that strange and WitchCRaFT mysterious things would soon be hap-
pening all over the country. Mr Dursley hummed as he picked out
his most boring tie for work and Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.

None of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window.

At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked
Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley goodbye but
missed, because Dudley AnD was now having a tantrum and throwing
his cereal at the walls. ‘Little tyke,’ chortled Mr Dursley as he left
the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s
drive.

It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign
of something peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr
Dursley didn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked his head
around to look again. WizaRdry} There was a tabby cat standing on the corner
of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What could
he have been thinking of?
