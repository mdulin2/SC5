## Challenge 
Recently, while digging through an old computer, I found my old crypto wallet for a passphrase. However, the section for decoding was corrupted; only the encoding code was recovered. Can you recover the key? Passphrase: hallucinate-cat-victory-people-barley-giddy-kangaroo-yank. Please return the key in a base 32 format.


- Given: Pass phrase
- Given: Word lst
- Given: encode.py
- NOT given: decode.py
