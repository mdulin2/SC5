# OSINT Search and File Analysis

## Google Dorks

Using traditional web keyword searches can sometimes return millions of results. Google Dorks, on the other hand, are a powerful way to drill down into very specific search results among those millions.

Using google.com, locate an english language PDF that is hosted on the microsoft.com domain. This PDF talks about buying the food "wasabi" in a southern US state. 

What is the last name of the first author listed in the body of this PDF?

* Hint: What is a â€œgoogle dork?" Do they have a cheat sheet for these things?

## File Analysis

Another place that can give away information is in the metadata of files. Common files that have metadata are image files and document files (PDF, DOCX, etc.)

Let's practice pulling the metadata on the file from the previous challenge:

Locate the Producer metadata field. The flag is the first word of this field.

* Hint: Sure, could go online for the answer, but I wonder what a PDF looks like without the PDF viewer?
