# Hackermon Null Version

GameBoy reverse engineering challenge.

![Hackermon](screenshot.png)

Two-part challenge, requires a GameBoy emulator with some debugging capabilities. At minimum, a memory viewer and cheats support (e.g. Gameshark).

~~For MacOS, I found that VisualBoy Advance M works alright, kinda shitty. Windows and Linux users have a world of emulators to choose from.~~

Use [Emulicious](https://emulicious.net/)! Java-based emulator with killer debugging tools.
