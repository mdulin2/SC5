# Hackermon Null Version

GameBoy reverse engineering challenge.

![Hackermon](screenshot.png)

Two-part challenge, requires a GameBoy emulator with some debugging capabilities. At minimum, a memory viewer and cheats support (e.g. Gameshark).

For MacOS, I found that VisualBoy Advance M works alright, kinda shitty. Windows and Linux users have a world of emulators to choose from.
