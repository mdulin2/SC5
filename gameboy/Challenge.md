## Challenge 1: Hackermon Null Version

* Fire up an emulator (which is legal) to play this unlicensed GameBoy game that is totally not a ripoff of a popular franchise. There is an in-game computer! Try to hack it!

* Hint:

  - No debuggers, hex editors, or reverse engineering skills needed!

Unlocks Challenge 2

## Challenge 2: Hackermon Null Version (Hard)

* Did you hear that!? It came from the outside! What could that be??

* Hint:

  - The solution requires editing a byte or two in memory while the game is running. First, find the relevant byte. btw, does your emulator have Gameshark support?
