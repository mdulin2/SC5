## Airline Tickets
- Have you ever considered what's on an airline ticket? Your name? Location? Let's find out! This series of challenges will delve into a series of challenges to interact with an Arduino via QR codes.
- Given: A ticket with a valid checksum.

## Challenge 1
- What is the seat number and row of the airline ticket given? Reverse engineer the format!
- HINT: QR code is just a representation of text :)

## Challenge 2 
- Set the name of the ticket to be Elon Musk when scanning the QR code. Modify your airline ticket QR Code to do this.
- Scan the QR code on the ticket scanner to get the flag.

## Challenge 3 
- Set the ticket to be first class. Modify your airline ticket QR Code to do this.
- Scan the QR code on the ticket scanner to get the flag.
- HINT: What does the 'E' stand for? 
    - Too much... use this as a 'hint to give'.

## Challenge 4
- The final section of the ticket is a checksum.
- Modify the ticket with the flight number '9675309' with a valid checksum.
- Hint: A checksum is a value derived from the rest of the input to ensure that the data was not corrupted in transit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum
- Hint: Read the code
