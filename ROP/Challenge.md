## Challenge 
- Can you call all <b>seven</b> of the functions within the code? Some have parameters, while some don't.
- Hint: The parameters go FIRST in the input
- Hint: This feels like Return Oriented Programming (ROP). 


TODO: Should we give the requirements or make people look at the code for the parameters?
